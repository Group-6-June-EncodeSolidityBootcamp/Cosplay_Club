Cosplay Club conducts cosplay contests where users can submit their cosplay image on the theme/topic. Judges can use our ERC20 tokens to vote for the winner. A DAO is set up for admin actions like burning an inappropriate submission, closing the voting, etc.

- Submissions & Votes will be displayed on the frontend.
- Submissions are NFT.
- Erc20 token for voting.
- The winner will receive a special NFT Prize & Tokens.üèÜüíµü§ë

## Getting Started

This project uses Yarn Workspaces, so you'll need [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-ethereum-starter.git
cd nextjs-ethereum-starter

yarn install

# Start up the Hardhat Network
yarn chain
```

Here we just install the npm project's dependencies, and by running `yarn chain` we spin up an instance of Hardhat Network that you can connect to using MetaMask. In a different terminal in the same directory, run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy the contract to Hardhat Network. After this completes run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server and your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

To interact with the local contract, be sure to switch your MetaMask Network to `Localhost 8545`
